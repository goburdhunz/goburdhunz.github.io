          <h1>about me</h1>
          <p>I worked as a QA engineer at a tech company called Xing in Germany prior to starting the software engineering immersive course at General Assembly. I was part of a cross-functional development team working on Android, IOS, Web projects. I helped to build products, ensure a certain level of quality and make sure that the updated codebase was ready for release. Working as a QA made me want to learn how to develop software myself and not just to test and review the end product.<br/>
          <br/>
          I wanted to have a much more technical knowledge of software development and to be technically proficient enough to build out software projects myself. After learning how to wireframe, design and build a full-stack app with Javascript/Python, I am eager to take the step up to building solutions.

            <p>We had a brief to make use of vanilla JavaScript and Dom manipulation to build a game. I chose to build Frogger - a classic arcade game from the 80s.

            <i class="fab fa-github"></i>
            <p>After using React for the second module, we were tasked with building a React front-end which consumed a public API. This was a pair project, only using one laptop. We chose to consume the public API from Listen Notes, a podcast library website.

            <i class="fab fa-github"></i>
            <p>We used Node.js/Express/MongoDB in the third module and we were briefed with building a MERN-stack web app with authentication, database models, CRUD routes and register/login. We worked in groups of 4 and had to set up a repo on Github and fork individually. I chose to work on the Express back-end, setting up the back-end of the app; controllers, routing, mongoose models and basic token authentication. I also implemented a modal display and comments on the front-end.

            <i class="fas fa-link"></i>
            <i class="fab fa-github"></i>
            <p>After a one week introduction to Python and Django, we were tasked with building a web app with a React front-end and Django back-end. The database models were required to have 1:M or M:M relationships to other models, and we had to creatively display the resulting data on the frontend. I built an app which was user focused and combined a blogging functionality with tailored news, job and events services. I used three external REST APIs for the tailored content and created Django models for the main user and the blog in the back-end. Users could register, login, create a blog, view all blogs, and when logged in - view personalised content based on their profile preferences. We only had one week for this project but it was a great learning experience, especially for the Django backend, SQLite and database migrations.
