          <div class="contentcontainer">
            <div class="intro">
              <p class="introcontent">I worked as a QA engineer at a tech company called Xing in Germany prior to starting the software engineering immersive course at General Assembly. I was part of a cross-functional development team working on Android, IOS, Web projects. <br>
              <br>
              I helped to build products, ensure a certain level of quality and make sure that the updated codebase was ready for release. Working as a QA made me want to learn how to develop software myself and not just to test and review the end product.<br/>
              <br/>
              I wanted to have a much more technical knowledge of software development and to be technically proficient enough to build out software projects myself. <br/>
              <br/>
              After learning how to wireframe, design and build a full-stack app with Javascript/Python, I am eager to take the step up to building solutions.
              </p>

            <div class="interest">
              <p class="interestcontent">I enjoy learning about developments in the world of cryptocurrency, especially news regarding new blockchain use cases and investing in new tokens/coins.
              <br>
              <br>
               I love travelling. I was lucky enough to work remote so i was able to travel and work from abroad. I think that travel makes a person grow and develop like nothing else. I try to visit somewhere new every couple of months.<br/>
              <br/>
              I live to eat! I enjoy cooking but mostly eating! Trying out new restaurants wherever I am in the world - you can a lot about a contrie's culture by what and how they eat.

            <p>We had a brief to make use of vanilla JavaScript and Dom manipulation to build a game. I chose to build Frogger - a classic arcade game from the 80s.

            <p>After using React for the second module, we were tasked with building a React front-end which consumed a public API. This was a pair project, only using one laptop. We chose to consume the public API from Listen Notes, a podcast library website.

            <p>We used Node.js/Express/MongoDB in the third module and we were briefed with building a MERN-stack web app with authentication, database models, CRUD routes and register/login. We worked in groups of 4 and had to set up a repo on Github and fork individually. <br>
            <br>
            I chose to work on the Express back-end, setting up the back-end of the app; controllers, routing, mongoose models and basic token authentication. I also implemented a modal display and comments on the front-end.

            <p>After a one week introduction to Python and Django, we were tasked with building a web app with a React front-end and Django back-end. The database models were required to have 1:M or M:M relationships to other models, and we had to creatively display the resulting data on the frontend.<br>
            <br>
            I built an app which was user focused and combined a blogging functionality with tailored news, job and events services. I used three external REST APIs for the tailored content and created Django models for the main user and the blog in the back-end. Users could register, login, create a blog, view all blogs, and when logged in - view personalised content based on their profile preferences.<br>
            <br>
            We only had one week for this project but it was a great learning experience, especially for the Django backend, SQLite and database migrations.

            <p>Intense, yet rewarding 12-week full-stack software engineering bootcamp aimed at providing all the necessary technical skills to find a job as a junior Software Engineer. The daily lessons were focused on topics such as JavaScript, React and Node.js/Express. We had challenges during the day to practice and reinforce the lesson as well as daily homework and projects to really solidify the topics covered.</p>

            <p>Worked as a freelance QA Engineer across Android, IOS and Web apps. It was incredible exposure to software engineering and something that really helped me to gain a foothold in the industry. I worked alongside different types of engineers; front-end, back-end, devops, data. This is where I made the decision to upskill and try to move to the next step and engineer solutions myself.</p>
